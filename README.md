# Vehicle Routing Problem using Ant Colony Optimization

This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a combinatorial optimization problem. The VRP involves finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, subject to various constraints.

## Overview

The project is implemented in juyter notebook by python and consists of the following components:
1. hant_vehivle_routing.ipynb :The main script that performs the ACO algorithm and mutation and other relative method and classes for solving the VRP.
2. `dataset/`: c106c6.txt solomon dataset
## Usage

To run the project, make sure you have Python and jupyter notebook installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-routing-aco.git
cd vehicle-routing-aco
